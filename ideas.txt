--Snake, only the "apples" you eat are letters.
	--Every letter you swallow is appended to your butt.
	--Every time your butt spells a (common?) word (of rather high minimum length, like 5 or so?) then your length shrinks by that much and you get points based on something like a scrabble word score
		--or maybe your butt never shrinks
	--Keep going until you run into yourself
		--or maybe until you spell a "forbidden" word
